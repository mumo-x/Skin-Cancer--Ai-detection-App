## Overview

**SkinDetect** is a web-based tool designed to help users assess the potential risk of skin cancer by analyzing key features of skin lesions. Unlike apps that require photo uploads, SkinDetect adopts a feature-based approachâ€”allowing users to input specific characteristics of their skin lesions for intelligent analysis.

## Key Features

### 1. Feature-Based Analysis

Users can provide details for **five critical characteristics** of their skin lesions:

- **Color**: Brown, black, blue/gray, red, white, or multi-colored
- **Size**: Measured in millimeters
- **Shape**: Symmetric, asymmetric, irregular borders, or regular borders
- **Texture**: Smooth, rough, scaly, ulcerated, or crusty
- **Evolution**: Whether the lesion has changed over time

### 2. Intelligent Risk Assessment

The application uses a sophisticated **rule-based algorithm** that:

- Assigns weights to each feature based on clinical importance
- Calculates a comprehensive risk score
- Assesses the likelihood of various skin conditions
- Provides a confidence level for each prediction

### 3. User-Friendly Interface

- Clean, intuitive, and responsive design
- Simple form-based input system
- Clear and informative visualization of results
- Educational resources about skin cancer types

### 4. Comprehensive Results

After submission, users receive:

- A summary of the entered features
- A primary prediction with its confidence level
- Alternative possible diagnoses
- A visual confidence indicator

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Analysis Engine**: Rule-based algorithm with weighted risk assessment
- **Deployment**: Ready to deploy on any standard web server

## Educational Value

SkinDetect also serves as an educational tool, helping users learn about:

- Key dermatological features used in diagnosis
- The ABCDE rule of skin cancer detection (Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter, Evolution)
- Different types of skin cancer and their characteristics
